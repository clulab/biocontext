Grf40 , A Novel Grb2 Family Member , Is Involved in T Cell Signaling through Interaction with SLP-76 and LAT .
We molecularly cloned a new Grb2 family member , named Grf40 , containing the common  SH3-SH2-SH3 motif .
Expression of Grf40 is predominant in hematopoietic cells , particularly  T cells .
Grf40 binds to the SH2 domain containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD ( SLP-76 ) via  its SH3 domain more tightly than Grb2 .
Incidentally , Grf40 binds to linker for activation of  T cells ( LAT ) possibly via its SH2 domain .
Overexpression of wild-type Grf40 in Jurkat cells induced a significant increase of SLP-76-dependent interleukin ( IL ) -2 promoter and nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NF-AT ) activation upon T cell receptor ( TCR ) stimulation , whereas the  COOH-terminal SH3 deleted Grf40 mutant lacked any recognizable increase in IL-2 promoter  activity .
Furthermore , the SH2 deleted Grf40 mutant led to a marked inhibition of these regulatory activities , the effect of which is apparently stronger than that of the SH2 deleted Grb2 mutant .
Our data suggest that Grf40 is an adaptor molecule involved in TCR mediated signaling  through a more efficient interaction than Grb2 with SLP-76 and LAT .
Stimulation of the TCR initiates activation of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) 1  that trigger downstream signaling pathways including calcium- and Ras- dependent events , which ultimately converge upon the  nucleus to stimulate the transcription of genes required for  proliferation and effector functions of T cells ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ) .
Phospholipase Cgamma1 , recruited to the plasma membrane after PTK  activation , is thought to introduce the calcium dependent  pathway into the TCR mediated signaling events ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ) .
On the other hand , the pathway for Ras activation after  PTK activation in T cells is still controversial .
Grb2 , an  adaptor protein containing an SH3-SH2-SH3 motif , forms  a complex with Sos , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ,  via its NH 2 -terminal SH3 domain after TCR ligation ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ) .
Hence , the Grb2 and Sos complex is thought to contribute to  Ras activation in T cells , although there has been no empirical evidence for this notion .
The COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 has been  shown to bind to the SH2 domain containing leukocyte  protein of 76 kD ( SLP-76 ) , a hematopoietic cell specific  adaptor protein , which is tyrosine phosphorylated rapidly  after TCR stimulation ( XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ) .
Mice targeted for SLP-76  gene engendered defects of double positive T cells in the  thymus and of peripheral T cells as a consequence of impaired pre-TCR signaling ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Furthermore , Jurkat subline  J14 cells lacking expression of SLP-76 exhibited defects of  both the calcium- and Ras dependent pathways in TCR mediated signaling .
The defect of the calcium dependent  pathway in this system is ascribed to the fact that tyrosine  phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cgamma1 are  significantly suppressed in J14 cells ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Although the precise function of SLP-76 in Ras activation is still obscure , it is  of interest that deletion of the Grb2 binding site of SLP-76  eliminates the ability of SLP-76 to increase IL-2 promoter  activity upon stimulation with the TCR ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ) .
In addition , SLP-76 also binds to Vav , a member of the guanine  nucleotide exchange factor family , and cotransfection with  SLP-76 and Vav into Jurkat cells induced a synergistic increase of nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NF-AT ) activation upon TCR stimulation ( XREF_BIBR ) .
These observations suggest  that SLP-76 is an indispensable mediator of TCR signaling .
On the other hand , the SH2 domain of Grb2 has been  shown to bind to linker for activation of T cells ( LAT ) , a  ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase substrate , upon TCR stimulation ,  and the LAT mutant , lacking an interaction site for the  SH2 domain , has a dominant negative effect on TCR stimulated signaling ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Hence Grb2 , an adaptor protein , has  been considered to be implicated in TCR mediated signaling .
We here provide evidence that a new Grb2 family member , named Grf40 , is involved in TCR mediated signaling  through its more efficient interaction than Grb2 with SLP-76  and LAT .
Materials and Methods .
Cloning of the cDNA .
.
Grf40 cDNA fragments were isolated  by a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human PHA-PBL cDNA library ( Clontech ) .
The bait plasmid was constructed by insertion  of a cDNA fragment encoding the full-length human AMSH  protein ( our unpublished protocol ) in pAS2-1 ( Clontech ) .
The  bait plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain CG1945 ( Clontech ) , followed by transformation with the human PHA-PBL  cDNA library .
The transformed strains were selected on dropout  plates ( Trp - , Leu - , His - ) with 5 mM 3-aminotriazole .
Positive  colonies were subsequently tested for the expression of lacZ .
One  clone was determined to contain a homologous sequence to  Grb2 ( XREF_BIBR ) .
To obtain the full-length cDNA , the 800-bp fragment  of the above clone was used as a probe for screening a lambdagt11  oligo ( dT )-primed cDNA library of PHA-PBL .
The sequences of  10 clones were identical , and two of them contained an open  reading frame coding for 330 amino acids .
This sequence contains an in-frame stop codon at 114 bp upstream of the first methionine codon , and the sequence around the first methionine  ( nucleotides 193-195 ) matches the favorable Kozak consensus sequence .
A full-length cDNA encoding Grf40 was thus isolated .
Plasmid Construction .
.
Grf40 cDNA was generated by PCR  using the above full-length cDNA clone as a template and subcloned into Myc-Tag-pcDNA3 .1 ( + ) to generate the plasmid  sequence ( EQKLISEEDL ) .

pMycGrb2 and  pMycGrb2-dSH2 are expression plasmids for the Myc tagged  wild-type Grb2 and Grb2 mutant deleted of the SH2 domain  ( amino acid position Trp 60 -Glu 152 ) , respectively .
SLP-76 cDNA  was generated by PCR and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV-2 ( Eastman Kodak Co. ) to generate the plasmid pFlagSLP , possessing an  NH 2 -terminal Flag epitope tag ( DYKDDDDK ) .
pFlagSLP-157-533 , pFlagSLP-217-533 , pFlagSLP-241-533 , and pFlagSLP-281-533 are expression plasmids for Flag tagged SLP-76 mutants deleted  of amino acid positions Met 1 -Leu 156 , Met 1 -His 216 , Met 1 -Lys 240 ,  and Met 1 -Pro 280 , respectively .
pCX-SLP76 is an expression plasmid for the wild-type SLP-76 cloned into the pCXN2 vector  ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Luciferase reporter constructs were as follows : pNFATLuc  was constructed by insertion of three tandem copies of the NF-AT  binding region ( -286 to -249 of human IL-2 ) linked to the human IL-2 promoter ( -64 to +47 ) into the pGL3-basic vector  ( Promega ) ( XREF_BIBR ) ; pIL2Luc was constructed by insertion of the human IL-2 promoter ( -541 to +57 ) into the pGL3-basic vector  ( XREF_BIBR ) .
pENL is a beta-galactosidase expression plasmid ( XREF_BIBR ) .
All constructs were sequenced for verification with a DNA sequencer  ( model 377 ; Applied Biosystems , Inc. ) .

For luciferase assays , Jurkat cells were electroporated with  2.5 mug of pENL and the indicated dose of pIL2Luc or pNFATLuc ,  along with expression plasmids for SLP-76 , and Grf40 or Grb2 in  OPTI-MEM I at a density of 5 x 10 6  cells/400 mul at 200 V and  950 muF .
The cells were cultured at 37degreesC for 24 h , and then stimulated for 8 h with 10 mug/ml OKT3 plus 50 ng/ml PMA or with 10  mug/ml OKT3 alone .
The cells were then lysed in 300 mul of  PicaGene ReporterLysis Buffer ( Toyo Ink ) and assayed for luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities as described previously ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Results and Discussion .
We previously reported a signal transducing adaptor  molecule , STAM , which is associated with Janus kinase  ( Jak ) 2 and Jak3 and is involved in signal transduction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We have also recently  cloned a cDNA clone encoding a novel molecule , named  AMSH , which binds to STAM ( our unpublished results ) .
To address the functional significance of AMSH , we attempted to identify molecules associated with AMSH using  the yeast two-hybrid assay system .
One full-length cDNA  clone was isolated from a human PHA-PBL cDNA library .
The cDNA clone encodes a molecule homologous to  Grb2 , named Grf40 ( for Grb2 family member of 40 kD ) .
The nucleotide sequence of the Grf40 gene has been deposited with GenBank , and is available from EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ under accession no .
AF042380 .
The deduced  amino acid sequence of Grf40 consists of 330 amino acid  residues .
The schematic structure of Grf40 was compared  with Grb2 ( XREF_BIBR ) and Grap , another Grb2 family member ( XREF_BIBR ,   XREF_BIBR ) .
The NH 2 - and COOH-terminal SH3 domains and an  intermediate SH2 domain of Grf40 are highly homologous  to those of Grb2 and Grap , while a unique insert region  ( amino acid position Arg 156 -Arg 277 ) containing proline / glutamine rich sequences was seen in Grf40 but not Grb2  and Grap                                                .
These results indicate that Grf40 is a  new member of the Grb2 family .
Various human cell lines were examined for expression  of Grf40 by immunoblotting with anti-Grf40 Ab .
Two T  cell lines , MOLT-4 and Jurkat , were strongly positive for  expression of the 40-kD Grf40 , and two B cell lines , Daudi  and Raji , were weakly positive , but the other cell lines , including a B cell line ( Ramos ) , myeloid cell lines ( THP-1 ,  TF-1 , and Eol-3 ) , and the nonhematopoietic cell lines  ( HeLa and WI-26 ) were all negative for this expression                                                 .
In contrast to Grf40 , appreciable expression of  Grb2 was seen in all the cell lines                                                .
Northern blot  analyses on various human cell lines and tissues showed two  Grf40 specific transcripts at 3.5 and 1.5 kb in Jurkat ,  MOLT-4 , three myeloid cell lines ( KU812 , K562 , and  M-TAT ) and PHA-PBL ( data not shown ) , and in human  immunotissues such as thymus , spleen , small intestine , and  PBL , whereas marginal levels of the transcripts were detected  in other tissues , including prostate , testis , ovary , colon , heart ,  brain , placenta , lung , liver , skeletal muscle , kidney , and pancreas                                                .
These results suggest that Grf40 , unlike  Grb2 , is predominantly expressed in immunotissues and  hematopoietic cells , particularly T cells .
Since Grb2 has been shown to bind to SLP-76 and LAT ,  which are 76- and 36/38-kD tyrosine phosphorylated proteins essential for TCR mediated signaling , respectively  ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ) , we asked ourselves whether or not Grf40 is  also associated with SLP-76 and LAT .
We detected 76- and  36/38-kD tyrosine phosphorylated proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with Grf40 in Jurkat cells after stimulation by  TCR cross linking with OKT3                                                .
We then confirmed that the 76- and 36/38-kD tyrosine phosphorylated  proteins were SLP-76 and LAT , respectively , by stimulating Jurkat cells with OKT3 .
Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grf40 Ab , and the immunoprecipitates  were then immunoblotted with anti-LAT , anti-SLP-76 , or  anti-Grf40 Ab .
Grf40 precipitated SLP-76 irrespective of  TCR stimulation , but precipitated LAT only after TCR  stimulation                                                .
These results indicate the association  of Grf40 with SLP-76 and LAT in Jurkat cells .
To determine the association site of Grf40 for SLP-76 , we carried  out further coimmunoprecipitation assays between the various deletion mutants of Grf40 and SLP-76 .
COS7 cells  were transiently transfected with Myc tagged wild-type  Grf40 and four Grf40 mutants deleted of the NH 2 -terminal  SH3 domain ( Grf40-dSH3N ) , the COOH-terminal SH3  domain ( Grf40-dSH3C ) , both the NH 2 - and COOH-terminal SH3 domains ( Grf40-dSH3NC ) , or the SH2 domain  ( Grf40-dSH2 ) .
The transfected COS7 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-SLP-76 Ab or anti-Myc mAb , and  then immunoblotted with anti-Myc mAb or anti-SLP-76  Ab .
Wild-type Grf40 and the Grf40-dSH2 and Grf40 dSH3N  mutants were coimmunoprecipitated with SLP-76 , but the  Grf40-dSH3C and Grf40 dSH3NC mutants were not tested                                                 .
Conversely , SLP-76 was coimmunoprecipitated  with Grf40-dSH2 , Grf40-dSH3N , and wild-type Grf40 ,  but not with Grf40-dSH3C and Grf40 dSH3NC mutants  ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grf40 is an association site for  SLP-76 .
We next determined the association site of SLP-76  for Grf40 by using various SLP-76 mutants .
Flag tagged  wild-type and four mutants of SLP-76 were introduced  into COS7 cells together with Myc tagged Grf40 , and then  immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-Flag  and anti-Myc Abs .
Myc tagged Grf40 was coimmunoprecipitated with the SLP-76 mutants consisting of and containing the amino acid position Glu 217 -Pro 533 , but not with  the SLP-76 mutant consisting of the amino acid position  Pro 241 -Pro 533 .
These results indicate that the Grf40 binding  site is located in the amino acid position Glu 217 -Lys 240  of  SLP-76                                                .
This Grf40 binding site of SLP-76  almost overlaps the amino acid position Asn 224 -Asp 244 ,  which has been shown to be the Grb2 binding site ( XREF_BIBR ) .
On the other hand , the binding site of Grb2 for LAT has  been shown to be the SH2 domain of Grb2 , which is  thought to bind to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue  ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Together with this notion , we showed that LAT is tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently coimmunoprecipitated with Grf40 after TCR stimulation , suggesting that the  SH2 domain of Grf40 is possibly the binding site for LAT .
Since the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 has  been shown to be the binding site for SLP-76 ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ) , we  examined the competitive binding ability between Grf40  and Grb2 to SLP-76 .
COS7 cells were transiently transfected with 2.5-mug plasmids of Myc tagged Grf40 and  Myc tagged Grb2 in association with different doses ( 0-1 .0  mug ) of Flag tagged SLP-76 plasmid .
Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag mAb and then immunoblotted with anti-Myc polyclonal Ab .
Coimmunoprecipitation of Myc tagged Grf40 with SLP-76 gradually decreased  upon reducing the SLP-76 plasmid dose to 0.05 mug ,  whereas the Myc tagged Grb2 coimmunoprecipitation with  SLP-76 was detectable only at a 1.0-mug dose of SLP-76  plasmid                                                .
Expression levels of the plasmids introduced were quantified by immunoblotting , confirming that  there was no significant difference in the amounts between  Myc tagged Grf40 and Myc tagged Grb2                                                .
These  results suggest the possibility that Grf40 associated much  stronger with SLP-76 than did Grb2 .
To confirm this further , COS7 cells were transiently transfected with low  doses of SLP-76 plasmid ( 0.2 mug ) and Myc-Grf40 plasmid  ( 2.5 mug ) together with various doses ( 0-10 mug ) of Myc tagged Grb2 plasmid .
Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag mAb and then immunoblotted with  anti-Myc polyclonal Ab .
Even when up to 10-mug plasmid  doses of Myc tagged Grb2 were cotransfected , coimmunoprecipitation of Myc tagged Grf40 with SLP-76 was still  unchanged                                                .
Furthermore , although the increased  expression of Myc tagged Grb2 was dependent on its plasmid dose , which was considerably higher than that of Grf40  at a 10-mug plasmid dose of Myc tagged Grb2 , Myc tagged  Grb2 was not coimmunoprecipitated with SLP-76                                                 .
These results indicate that Grf40 competes with Grb2  in its binding to SLP-76 , and the binding affinity of Grf40 to  SLP-76 is apparently higher than that of Grb2 .
Since the  SLP-76 mutant deleted of the Grb2 binding site , which  overlaps the Grf40 binding site , failed to increase IL-2 promoter activity upon TCR stimulation ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ) , it is possible  that not only Grb2 but also Grf40 plays a critical role in the  SLP-76-dependent increase in IL-2 promoter activity .
To address the functional significance of Grf40 in TCR mediated signaling , we performed luciferase assays with reporter genes containing the IL-2 promoter and the NF-AT  binding domain .
Overexpression of wild-type Grf40 did  not lead to either basal or TCR mediated activation of the  IL-2 promoter and NF-AT ( data not shown ) .
Since Grf40  interacts with SLP-76 in Jurkat cells , and overexpression of  SLP-76 is known to augment TCR mediated stimulation  of the IL-2 promoter and NF-AT activity ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ) , we used  Jurkat cells transiently transfected with SLP-76 to examine  the effect of Grf40 in TCR mediated signaling .
Transfections of wild-type Grf40 and Grf40 dSH3N mutant into  Jurkat cells overexpressing SLP-76 led to significant increases  in IL-2 promoter activity upon stimulation with OKT3 plus  PMA , whereas transfection of Grf40 dSH2 mutant induced  a marked inhibition of IL-2 promoter activity compared  with transfection of an empty vector                                                .
These results  indicate that Grf40 dSH2 mutant has a dominant negative  effect in TCR stimulation , suggesting that the SH2 domain  of Grf40 interacts with an essential molecule for TCR mediated signaling , which is possibly LAT ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Similar results  were obtained in NF-AT luciferase assays with Jurkat cells  stimulated with OKT3                                                .
Furthermore , the Grf40  mutants ( Grf40-dSH3C and Grf40-dSH3NC ) deleted of the  COOH-terminal SH3 domain , which is the binding site  for SLP-76 , also lost their ability to increase IL-2 promoter  activity                                                , suggesting that a Grf40 and SLP-76 complex  formation is required for SLP-76-dependent TCR stimulation .
These results indicate that Grf40 is involved in signaling  the stimulation of the IL-2 promoter and NF-AT activities  mediated by OKT3 and PMA .
Since Grb2 has also been considered to be involved in  the modulation of TCR mediated signal transduction ( XREF_BIBR ) ,  we compared the functional significance of Grf40 and  Grb2 in TCR mediated stimulation of IL-2 promoter activity .
Jurkat cells overexpressing SLP-76 were transfected  with the wild-types and SH2 deletion mutants of Grf40  and Grb2 , in association with an IL-2 promoter driven luciferase construct .
They were stimulated with OKT3 plus  PMA , and assayed for luciferase activity .
An appreciable enhancement of IL-2 promoter activity was seen with wild-type Grf40 , but scarcely with wild-type Grb2 , whereas  Grf40 dSH2 mutant showed a marked dominant negative  effect in the IL-2 luciferase assay compared with Grb2 dSH2  mutant                                                .
The plasmid dose dependency in the IL-2  luciferase assay was compared between the Grf40-dSH2 and  Grb2 dSH2 mutants .
The suppressive effects on the luciferase activities were significantly stronger in Grf40 dSH2  mutant than Grb2 dSH2 mutant at various plasmid doses                                                 .
These results indicate that Grf40 is involved in  TCR mediated signaling more effectively than Grb2 .
This  conclusion is in accordance with the observation of greater  binding affinity of Grf40 to SLP-76 compared with Grb2 .
This study showed a critical involvement of Grf40 in the  SLP-76-dependent signaling mediated by the TCR .
One  might consider the possibility that Grf40 mutants exert  their effects in TCR mediated signaling by altering expression levels of SLP-76 .
However , this possibility is negligible  because the expression of pCX-SLP76 was confirmed to be  unaffected by transient expression of Grf40 , Grb2 , and their  mutants in COS7 cells ( data not shown ) .
Hence , the interaction of Grf40 with SLP-76 and LAT is thought to be  critical for TCR mediated signaling .
The NH 2 -terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 is known to be  a binding site for Sos , a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange  factor , which has been considered to be involved in Ras  activation upon TCR stimulation ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We confirmed the  association of Grb2 with Sos in Jurkat cells ; however , a  complex formation between Grf40 and Sos was undetectable in these cells ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , we suspect  that Grf40 does not direct the Ras activation signaling mediated by the TCR .
However , Grf40 contributes to TCR mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter and NF-AT  more effectively than Grb2 , suggesting the critical involvement of Grf40 in TCR mediated signaling .
In this context ,  it is of interest that SLP-76 associated with Grf40 also binds  to Vav , a Rac and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor , and  that the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav has been shown  to participate in IL-2 gene activation upon TCR stimulation  ( XREF_BIBR ) .
These observations provide a model pathway in which  activated ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase after TCR ligation phosphorylates LAT ( XREF_BIBR ) , which then binds to the preformed  Grf40 and SLP-76 complex and recruits it to ZAP-70 ( XREF_BIBR ) , which  further phosphorylates SLP-76 to be associated with Vav ,  leading to the downstream signaling of the TCR .
Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that  Grf40 is expressed predominantly in immunotissues and hematopoietic cells , particularly T cells , in contrast to Grb2 .
Such restricted distribution of Grf40 may reflect the more efficient involvement of Grf40 in TCR mediated signaling  compared with Grb2 .
Although Grap has also been shown  to be specific for hematopoietic and lymphocytic cells ( XREF_BIBR ) ,  the functional significance of Grap is still unknown .
The genome sequence of GRB2L has been registered  in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ ( under accession no .
Z82206 ) ,  which contains the entire sequence of Grf40 .
Since GRB2L  has been mapped to human chromosome 22q12 , Grf40 is  thought to have the same chromosomal location .
Furthermore , cDNA clones identical to Grf40 were reported as  Grap2 ( XREF_BIBR ) , and human Gads ( XREF_BIBR ) and their mouse homologues , named Mona ( XREF_BIBR ) and mouse Gads ( XREF_BIBR ) , were also reported after the submission of this paper .
Although the report  regarding human Gads showed similar results as our study ,  they did not show any comparative study between Gads and  Grb2 .
We here show evidence suggesting that Grf40 plays a  more critical role in the TCR mediated signaling than Grb2 .
