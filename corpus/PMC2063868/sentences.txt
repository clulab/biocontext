Semaphorin 4D/Plexin-B 1 mediated R-Ras GAP activity inhibits cell migration by regulating beta 1  integrin activity .
Plexins are cell surface receptors for semaphorins and regulate cell migration in many cell types .
We recently reported that the semaphorin 4D ( Sema4D ) receptor Plexin-B1 functions as a GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) for R-Ras , a member of Ras family GTPases implicated in regulation of integrin activity and cell migration ( Oinuma , I. , Y. Ishikawa , H. Katoh , and M. Negishi .

We characterized the role of R-Ras downstream of Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 in cell migration .
Activation of Plexin-B1 by Sema4D suppressed the ECM dependent R-Ras activation , R-Ras-mediated phosphatydylinositol 3-kinase activation , and beta 1  integrin activation through its R-Ras GAP domain , leading to inhibition of cell migration .
In addition , inactivation of R-Ras by overexpression of the R-Ras-specific GAP or knockdown of R-Ras by RNA interference was sufficient for suppressing beta 1  integrin activation and cell migration in response to the ECM stimulation .
Thus , we conclude that R-Ras activity is critical for ECM mediated beta 1  integrin activation and cell migration and that inactivation of R-Ras by Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 mediated R-Ras GAP activity controls cell migration by modulating the activity of beta 1  integrins .
Introduction .
Semaphorins comprise a large family of secreted and transmembrane molecules that play central roles in axon guidance in the developing nervous system ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) .
The function of semaphorins is mediated by plexins , which are classified into four subfamilies : Plexin-A , -B , -C , and -D ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Semaphorins were originally identified as repulsive axonal guidance molecules , but they have recently been shown to regulate integrin mediated cell migration in a variety of cells ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Sema3A exerts an essential permissive role in the execution of vasculature remodeling by inhibiting integrin mediated adhesion of endothelial cells to the ECM ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Activation of Plexin-B1 negatively regulates integrin based cell adhesion and migration of NIH-3T3 cells ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Plexin-C1 inhibits integrin mediated adhesion and chemokine induced migration of dendritic cells ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Thus , semaphorin and plexin signaling plays an important role in the migration of a variety of cells .
However , the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of integrin mediated cell migration by semaphorins through plexins remain unclear .
Rho family small GTPases are signal transduction molecules that remodel the actin cytoskeleton and play fundamental roles in numerous cellular processes ( XREF_BIBR ) .
The small GTPase Rnd1 , a constitutively active GTPase ( XREF_BIBR ) , is known to interact directly with the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1 ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We recently revealed that Plexin-B1 functions as an R-Ras GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) and directly and specifically down-regulates R-Ras activity in response to Sema4D , inducing repulsive response in hippocampal neurons , and that the expression of R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 requires Rnd1 association with the receptor ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Furthermore , expression of constitutively active R-Ras prevents growth cone collapse induced by Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 as well as Sema3A and Plexin-A 1 , whereas R-Ras siRNA caused a growth cone collapse similar to those induced by semaphorins ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Integrins are a family of alpha/beta heterodimeric cell surface receptors that bind to the ECM , such as collagens and fibronectins , and play a central part in regulating cell growth , survival , migration , and tumor metastasis ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Activation of integrins is essential for cell adhesion and cell migration , and several studies show that the Ras family of small GTPases regulates integrin activity ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Among the Ras family GTPases , activated R-Ras was shown to induce integrin activation and increase cell adhesion and matrix assembly , suggesting that R-Ras plays an important role in the regulation of integrin activity ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) .
However , how R-Ras activity is regulated and how R-Ras activates integrins remain obscure .
Significantly , Sema4D was the first extracellular stimulus shown to influence the activity of R-Ras .
These facts collectively prompted us to speculate that plexins regulate integrin mediated cell migration by their R-Ras GAP activity .
In this study , we characterized the role of R-Ras downstream of Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 in regulation of integrin activation and cell migration .
The activation of R-Ras by ECM is required for ECM mediated integrin activation and cell migration , and Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 inhibits integrin activation and cell migration through R-Ras GAP activity .
We also revealed that down-regulation of phosphatydylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) activity is responsible for Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 induced suppression of beta 1  integrin activity and cell migration .
Results .
Sema4D antagonizes integrin mediated cell migration .
We examined the effect of Sema4D on integrin mediated migration of PC12 cells in a cell migration assay ( XREF_FIG ) .
Transwell chambers were coated on the lower side with varying concentrations of collagen I. PC12 cells exhibited a collagen concentration dependent promotion of cell migration , which was antagonized by Sema4D .
The collagen dependent PC12 cell migration is mediated by alpha 1  and beta 1  integrin subunits , as functional blocking antibodies against alpha 1  ( XREF_FIG ) and beta 1  ( XREF_FIG ) integrin subunits strongly impaired the migration .
These results indicate that Sema4D antagonizes the collagen receptor , alpha 1 / beta 1  integrin dependent PC12 cell migration .
Sema4D through Plexin-B1 inhibits ECM mediated activation of R-Ras and beta 1  integrins .
R-Ras is implicated in integrin mediated cell migration , and expression of a constitutively active form of R-Ras has been shown to stimulate cell migration ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We previously reported that Sema4D stimulation down-regulates NGF stimulated R-Ras activity via the R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 to induce neurite retraction ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We next tested whether stimulation of PC12 cells with collagen and Sema4D affects R-Ras activity .
PC12 cells were plated onto collagen coated dishes and lysed , and the lysates were incubated with the GST fused Ras binding domain of c-Raf-1 ( GST-RBD ) to pull down activated R-Ras ( XREF_BIBR ) .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , cells plated on collagen coated dishes showed a collagen concentration dependent increase in endogenous R-Ras activity , whereas those kept in suspension or plated onto the non-integrin-dependent substrate poly-d-lysine did not .
Furthermore , the collagen dependent activation of R-Ras was inhibited by a functional blocking antibody against beta 1  integrins , P5D2 , and was enhanced by affinity related activation of beta 1  integrins by the monoclonal antibody 8A2 , which mechanically induces a high-affinity state of beta 1  integrins .
These data suggest that beta 1  integrins are required for R-Ras activation upon ECM mediated adhesion .
Sema4D stimulation strongly inhibited the collagen induced activation of R-Ras , and affinity related activation of beta 1  integrins by the 8A2 antibody attenuated the inhibitory effect of Sema4D on ECM mediated R-Ras activation .
R-Ras is known to regulate beta 1  integrin activation ( XREF_BIBR ) .
To examine the effect of Sema4D on beta 1  integrin activity , we measured the activity of beta 1  integrins in cells with or without Sema4D stimulation by the immunoprecipitation assay with the monoclonal antibody against active conformations of beta 1  integrins , HUTS-4 , which detects hybrid domain swing-out in beta 1  integrins , a process most commonly associated with ligand binding ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Sema4D antagonized the collagen dependent activation of beta 1  integrins ( XREF_FIG ) .
Inhibition of beta 1  integrin activity by Sema4D was also observed in the ELISA using the HUTS-4 antibody , which was performed under a detergent-free condition ( XREF_FIG ) .
To further ascertain that Sema4D indeed affects the activity of beta 1  integrins , we performed flow cytometry analysis using the HUTS-4 antibody .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , cells treated with Sema4D showed a decrease in the level of HUTS-4 binding ( FITC staining ) .
Mn 2+  treatment , which induces the activation of beta 1  integrins , resulting in the effective interaction with the ECM ligands and increased HUTS-4 binding ( XREF_BIBR ) , completely overcame the Sema4D induced decrease in HUTS-4 binding .
These results suggest that decreased HUTS-4 binding induced by Sema4D is due to affinity modulation of beta 1  integrins .
FAK is known to be autophosphorylated at tyrosine upon integrin activation ( XREF_BIBR ) , and FAK phosphorylation downstream of beta 1  integrins is the important step for integrin mediated cell migration ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , Sema4D inhibited the collagen mediated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation .
These results suggest that Sema4D inhibits ECM mediated activation of R-Ras and beta 1  integrins .
We also confirmed the involvement of the endogenous Plexin-B1 receptor in Sema4D dependent inhibition of R-Ras activity and integrin functions .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , both Sema4D dependent inhibition of collagen mediated activation of R-Ras and cell migration were blocked by the monoclonal antibody against Plexin-B1 , which recognizes the extracellular ligand binding region of the receptor .
These results suggest that Sema4D through Plexin-B1 inhibits ECM mediated activation of R-Ras , functional activation of beta 1  integrins , and inhibition of cell migration .
Inhibition of cell migration by Sema4D is mediated by suppression of beta 1  integrin activity .
We tested whether Sema4D mediated inhibition of cell migration is mediated by suppression of beta 1  integrin activity .
PC12 cells preincubated with 5 mug/ml beta 1  integrin activating monoclonal antibody ( 8A2 ) were subjected to the transwell assay .
We tested the migration at relatively low concentrations of collagen ( ~ 3.0 mug/ml ) because this antibody inhibits cell migration at high concentration of the ECM ligands by freezing beta 1  at a high-affinity state ( XREF_BIBR ) .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , affinity related activation of beta 1  integrins by 8A2 stimulation overcame the inhibitory effect of Sema4D on collagen mediated cell migration , whereas a control IgG2a antibody did not .
These results suggest that the inhibition of beta 1  integrin activity is required for the inhibition of cell migration by Sema4D .
Plexin-B1 inhibits ECM dependent activation of R-Ras and beta 1  integrins through its R-Ras GAP activity .
We recently reported that Plexin-B1 encodes R-Ras GAP within its cytoplasmic tail and that Plexin-B1 associated with the Rho family GTPase Rnd1 functions as a specific GAP toward R-Ras ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We examined whether Sema4D and Plexin-B 1-Rnd1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity suppresses adhesion dependent R-Ras activation .
COS-7 cells expressing R-Ras-wild type ( WT ) were plated onto fibronectin coated dishes or nonadherent control dishes and lysed , and the lysates were incubated with GST-RBD to pull down activated R-Ras .
The same cell lysates were also used for the immunoprecipitation assay using HUTS-4 for measurement of the activity of beta 1  integrins .
In COS-7 cells , fibronectin stimulation activated both R-Ras and beta 1  integrins ( XREF_FIG ) .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , expression of Plexin-B1-WT and Rnd1 inhibited the fibronectin mediated R-Ras activation in the presence of Sema4D .
However , this inhibitory effect was not observed in cells expressing Plexin-B1-GGA , a mutant lacking the ability to associate with Rnd1 , or Plexin-B1-RA , a mutant lacking primary and secondary arginine residues required for the catalytic activity of GAP .
These results suggest that Sema4D and Plexin-B 1-Rnd1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity inhibits adhesion dependent R-Ras activation .
To examine the effect of Sema4D and Plexin-B 1-Rnd1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity on beta 1  integrin activity , we measured the activity of beta 1  integrins in cells expressing Plexin-B1 and Rnd1 with or without Sema4D stimulation by the immunoprecipitation assay .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , expression of Plexin-B1 and Rnd1 strongly inhibited the fibronectin mediated beta 1  integrin activation in the presence of Sema4D , whereas inhibition of beta 1  integrin activation was not observed in cells expressing Plexin-B1-GGA or Plexin-B1-RA .
The same results were also obtained by the ELISA using the HUTS-4 antibody performed under a detergent-free condition ( XREF_FIG ) .
We also confirmed the results by flow cytometry analysis .
COS-7 cells transiently cotransfected with GFP-Rnd1 and Plexin-B1 were treated with Sema4D , and GFP expression and HUTS-4 binding ( phycoerythrin [ PE ] staining ) were simultaneously analyzed by two-color flow cytometry .
HUTS-4 binding ( PE staining ) was analyzed on a gated subset of cells positive for GFP expression to discriminate beta 1  integrin activity of transfected cells from that of untransfected cells .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , a Sema4D dependent decrease in HUTS-4 binding was observed in Plexin-B1-WT and Rnd1 expressing cells .
However , cells coexpressing Rnd1 with Plexin-B1-RA or Plexin-B1-GGA , which lacks R-Ras GAP activity , did not show a Sema4D dependent reduction in HUTS-4 binding .
In addition , Sema4D and Plexin-B 1-Rnd1 also inhibited the fibronectin mediated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation , whereas inhibition of FAK phosphorylation was not observed in cells expressing Plexin-B1-GGA or Plexin-B1-RA ( XREF_FIG ) .
These results suggest that Sema4D and Plexin-B 1-Rnd1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity inhibits adhesion dependent activation of R-Ras and thereby inhibits functional activation of beta 1  integrins .
R-Ras activity is required for the ECM mediated activation of beta 1  integrins .
We next examined whether regulation of R-Ras activity plays key roles in the ECM mediated activation of beta 1  integrins .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , in untransfected cells , activity of beta 1  integrins was increased upon adhesion to fibronectin .
This activation was completely blocked by the down-regulation of endogenous R-Ras activity by the expression of the myristoylated GAP domain of p98-R-RasGAP ( Myr-R-RasGAP ) , which exhibits a specific GAP activity toward R-Ras ( XREF_BIBR ) .
R-Ras is implicated in integrin regulation , and the constitutively active form of R-Ras has been shown to increase the affinity of beta 1  integrins for fibronectin ( XREF_BIBR ) and to stimulate cell migration ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Expression of R-Ras-QL actually induced remarkable activation of beta 1  integrins , and this was not further enhanced by fibronectin .
We also tested whether R-Ras activity affects FAK tyrosine phosphorylation .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , expression of Myr-R-RasGAP completely blocked the fibronectin induced FAK phosphorylation , whereas R-Ras-QL markedly stimulated FAK phosphorylation independent of fibronectin , indicating that endogenous R-Ras activity is also required for ECM mediated FAK phosphorylation .
We further confirmed requirement of R-Ras in the ECM mediated functional activation of beta 1  integrins .
We reduced expression of R-Ras in COS-7 cells by R-Ras-specific siRNA expression vector and examined the effect on the activation of beta 1  integrins and phosphorylation of FAK .
As shown in  XREF_FIG  ( C and D ) , expression of R-Ras siRNA effectively reduced endogenous R-Ras protein , and reduction in R-Ras protein blocked both the fibronectin dependent activation of beta 1  integrins and phosphorylation of FAK .
The ELISA using HUTS-4 , under detergent-free conditions , also confirmed suppression of beta 1  integrin activation by inactivation of R-Ras by expression of Myr-R-RasGAP or knockdown of R-Ras by R-Ras RNA interference ( XREF_FIG ) .
We also confirmed these results by two-color flow cytometry .
COS-7 cells transiently transfected with Myr- R-RasGAP or an R-Ras siRNA together with GFP were stained with HUTS-4 , and HUTS-4 binding ( PE staining ) was analyzed on GFP positive cells .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , the level of HUTS-4 binding was reduced in cells expressing Myr-R-RasGAP or R-Ras siRNA .
These results demonstrate that activation of the endogenous R-Ras protein is essential for the ECM mediated functional activation of beta 1  integrins .
Plexin-B1 inhibits cell migration through R-Ras GAP activity .
We next examined the effect of Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 signaling on integrin mediated cell migration .
COS-7 cells expressing a control GFP alone exhibited a fibronectin concentration dependent promotion of cell migration , and ectopic expression of GFP- R-Ras-WT enhanced this fibronectin dependent cell migration ( XREF_FIG ) .
Coexpression of Plexin-B1-WT and Rnd1 with R-Ras-WT blocked the R-Ras-induced promotion of cell migration toward fibronectin , in the presence of Sema4D at the lower well ( XREF_FIG ) .
On the other hand , expression of Plexin-B1-RA , a mutant of Plexin-B1 that lacks R-Ras GAP activity , did not exhibit the Sema4D dependent inhibition of cell migration toward fibronectin ( XREF_FIG ) .
Association of Rnd1 with Plexin-B1 is essential for the expression of R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 ( XREF_FIG ) , and inhibition of cell migration was not observed in the cells without Rnd1 or in the cells expressing Plexin-B1-GGA , a mutant of Plexin-B1 unable to interact with Rnd1 ( XREF_FIG ) .
The Plexin-B subfamily has been shown to activate RhoA via its COOH-terminal PDZ domain binding motif ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) .
However , Plexin-B1-DeltaC , a mutant of Plexin-B1 that lacks the PDZ domain binding motif but still has R-Ras GAP activity ( XREF_BIBR ) , inhibited fibronectin dependent cell migration in the presence of Sema4D ( XREF_FIG ) .
Cell migration mediated by constitutively active R-Ras , R-Ras-QL , was not suppressed by the Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 and Rnd1 complex ( XREF_FIG ) .
Expression levels of these constructs used in the assay were similar , as verified by immunoblot analysis ( not depicted ) .
Furthermore , R-Ras activity is essential for ECM mediated cell migration , as both inactivation of R-Ras by expression of Myr-R-RasGAP or knockdown of R-Ras by R-Ras RNA interference almost completely suppressed the fibronectin dependent cell migration ( XREF_FIG ) .
We further confirmed that the R-Ras GAP activity exhibited by endogenous Plexin-B1 is required for Sema4D mediated inhibition of ECM mediated PC12 cell migration .
We recently reported that the cytoplasmic region of Plexin-B1 by nature takes the intramolecularly tethered form and that disruption of the interaction between the NH 2 -terminal region ( N-Cyt ) and the COOH-terminal region ( C-Cyt ) within the cytoplasmic domain ( XREF_FIG ) by Rnd1 binding to N-Cyt is essential for exhibiting the R-Ras GAP activity .
C-Cyt associates with N-Cyt-GGA , which has no ability to interact with Rnd1 , and Rnd1 can not disrupt this interaction ( XREF_BIBR ) .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , overexpression of Plexin-B1-N-Cyt-GGA could effectively block the Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 and Rnd1 complex mediated R-Ras GAP activity , suggesting that Plexin-B1- N-Cyt-GGA could be an effective tool to inhibit the R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 in a dominant negative manner .
Overexpression of Plexin-B1-N-Cyt-GGA in PC12 cells almost completely blocked the Sema4D mediated inhibition of ECM mediated cell migration ( XREF_FIG ) .
We also examined the role of endogenous R-Ras protein in PC12 cell migration .
Transfection of the R-Ras siRNA effectively reduced the expression of endogenous R-Ras protein in PC12 cells , whereas the control siRNA did not work                                                                                                                                                                                            , and expression of R-Ras siRNA almost completely suppressed the collagen dependent cell migration                   , suggesting that R-Ras is a prime regulator for integrin mediated cell migration in PC12 cells .
These results demonstrate that activation of endogenous R-Ras protein is essential for the ECM mediated cell migration and that regulation of R-Ras activity through Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 mediated R-Ras GAP activity plays a key role in ECM mediated cell migration .
Sema4D and Plexin-B 1-Rnd1 inhibits PI3-K activity through its R-Ras GAP activity .
PI3-K is the predominant effector of R-Ras ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) , and R-Ras-mediated cell migration is sensitive to pharmacological PI3-K inhibitors ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) .
Expression of R-Ras-QL induces the ECM independent functional activation of beta 1  integrins and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK ( XREF_FIG ) and causes COS-7 cell migration in the absence of ECM ligands ( XREF_FIG ) .
The D64A mutation of R-Ras or the pharmacological PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the cell migration induced by R-Ras-QL ( XREF_FIG ) .
R-Ras-QL-64A , the effector loop mutant of R-Ras , impairs the ability of R-Ras to activate PI3-K ( XREF_BIBR ) , and R-Ras-QL-mediated phosphorylation of the PI3-K effector Akt ( PKB ) was abolished by the D64A mutation ( XREF_FIG ) .
We further examined the involvement of PI3-K in R-Ras-QL-induced activation of beta 1  integrins and subsequent FAK phosphorylation .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , D64A mutation or LY294002 treatment markedly blocked both R-Ras-QL-induced activation of beta 1  integrins and phosphorylation of the downstream effector FAK .
It has been reported that prominent PI3-K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt occurs in response to beta 1  integrin mediated adhesion ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We examined the effect of Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 mediated R-Ras GAP activity on PI3-K activity by measuring the phosphorylation of Akt .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , expression of Plexin-B1-WT and Rnd1 inhibited the fibronectin mediated Akt phosphorylation in the presence of Sema4D .
However , this inhibition was not observed in cells expressing Plexin-B1-GGA or Plexin-B1-RA that had no ability to exhibit R-Ras GAP activity ( XREF_FIG ) .
These results suggest that PI3-K activity is necessary for R-Ras-mediated activation of beta 1  integrins and that Sema4D and Plexin-B 1-Rnd1 inactivates PI3-K through down-regulation of R-Ras activity .
Down-regulation of PI3-K activity is responsible for Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 induced suppression of beta 1  integrin activity .
To clear out the role of PI3-K downstream of Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 , leading to suppression of beta 1  integrin activity , we transfected p110alpha-CAAX , a constitutively active form of PI3-K ( XREF_BIBR ) , and tested the ability of Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 to inhibit beta 1  integrin activation .
In COS-7 cells , overexpression of p110alpha-CAAX by itself did not induce beta 1  integrin activation in the absence of fibronectin ( XREF_FIG ;  XREF_BIBR ) .
On the other hand , overexpression of the kinase-dead form of p110alpha blocked the fibronectin dependent beta 1  integrin activation .
These results suggest that PI3-K activity is necessary but that PI3-K activity by itself is not sufficient for inducing beta 1  integrin activation .
We next examined whether the down-regulation of PI3-K activity downstream of Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 is necessary for inhibition of beta 1  integrin activity .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , overexpression of p110alpha-CAAX blocked Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 dependent inactivation of beta 1  integrins .
We also examined the ability of Sema4D to inhibit cell migration in cells expressing p110alpha-CAAX .
As shown in  XREF_FIG , overexpression of p110alpha-CAAX in PC12 cells almost completely blocked the Sema4D mediated inhibition of cell migration .
These results suggest that down-regulation of PI3-K activity , downstream of Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 , is responsible for suppression of beta 1  integrin activity and inhibition of the ECM mediated cell migration .
Discussion .
Cell migration is a fundamental cellular process in many cell types , and semaphorins are known to act as a negative regulator for integrin mediated cell migration .
We show that the Sema4D receptor , Plexin-B1 , down-regulates R-Ras activity and inhibits ECM mediated integrin activation and cell migration through its R-Ras GAP activity .
R-Ras is implicated in integrin regulation , and a constitutively active form of R-Ras has been shown to increase the affinity of integrins for fibronectin ( XREF_BIBR ) and to stimulate cell migration ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We have examined a role of R-Ras in ECM mediated integrin activation and cell migration and showed that R-Ras is markedly activated by the ECM and that this activation is required for activation of beta 1  integrins and subsequent cell migration , as inactivation of R-Ras activity by expression of the GAP domain of p98-R-RasGAP or knockdown of R-Ras by R-Ras-specific siRNA markedly reduces ECM mediated integrin activation and cell migration .
Our results also revealed that beta 1  integrins are required for R-Ras activation upon ECM mediated adhesion .
This suggests a positive feedback during cell-substrate adhesion , implicating R-Ras activation and the consequent further strengthening of integrin mediated functions .
Therefore , R-Ras is a central regulator for ECM mediated integrin activation and cell migration , and the regulation of R-Ras activity is critical for integrin mediated cell migration .
Semaphorins are implicated in migration of a variety of cells .
Stimulation of Plexin-B1 by Sema4D is reported to hamper integrin based adhesion and cell migration in NIH-3T3 cells ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We have reported that Plexin-B1 encodes an R-Ras GAP in the cytoplasmic tail and that stimulation of the Plexin-B1 and Rnd1 complex by Sema4D induces the R-Ras GAP activity and resultant repulsive response of neuronal growth cone ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We demonstrate here that Plexin-B1 and Rnd1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity is also involved in Sema4D induced inhibition of integrin activation and cell migration .
Furthermore , the COOH-terminal PDZ domain binding motif of Plexin-B1 is dispensable for suppression of integrin activity and cell migration by Sema4D .
In addition to Sema4D , class 3 semaphorins have been shown to control adhesion and migration of endothelial cells by inhibiting integrin function ( XREF_BIBR ) , and Sema3A signaling deficient mice have shown defective migration of neural crest cells ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Furthermore , Plexin-C1 , a receptor of semaphorin A39R , was recently reported to inhibit integrin mediated adhesion and chemokine induced migration ( XREF_BIBR ) .
The R-Ras GAP-homologous domains are well conserved among plexin families , including Plexin-A and -C1 .
In addition , we recently reported that the down-regulation of R-Ras activity is also required for the Sema3A and Plexin-A-induced repulsive response in hippocampal neurons ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We speculate that the direct regulation of R-Ras activity by plexins is likely to be a mutual signaling pathway among plexin families and that this R-Ras GAP activity of plexin families may be a critical signaling system for semaphorin regulated cell migration .
Semaphorins were initially identified as repulsive factors for axon guidance , and many neurons use members of the integrin family of cell surface receptors for responses to neurite growth promoting factors , and integrin activation regulates neurite outgrowth ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Recently , expression of constitutively active R-Ras was shown to promote integrin dependent neurite outgrowth of retinal neurons , suggesting that R-Ras activity plays an important role in integrin dependent neurite outgrowth ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Therefore , it is proposed that the down-regulation of R-Ras activity by Plexin-B1 via R-Ras GAP activity suppresses R-Ras-mediated integrin activation and thereby induces growth cone collapse and inhibition of neurite outgrowth .
With respect to signaling of other repulsive factors , the ephrin-B1 receptor EphB2 , another family of the repulsive factor receptor , was also reported to suppress integrin mediated functions by inactivating R-Ras ( XREF_BIBR ) , suggesting that repulsive guidance cues inhibit integrin mediated functions by inactivating R-Ras in general and that R-Ras acts as a common regulator of integrin activation and cell migration ( XREF_BIBR ) .
We also examined the downstream signaling of Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 mediated R-Ras GAP activity leading to inactivation of beta 1  integrins and found that down-regulation of PI3-K activity is responsible for Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 induced suppression of beta 1  integrin activity and cell migration .
PI3-K activity is known to be required for R-Ras-mediated enhancement of cell migration ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) .
PI3-K has emerged as the predominant effector for R-Ras , and R-Ras is a more potent activator of PI3-K than other Ras family members ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) .
On the other hand , PI3-K activity has been shown to promote interaction between talin with the beta 1  integrin cytoplasmic tail , leading to the clustering and activation of integrins ( XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ;  XREF_BIBR ) .
Integrin activation by mechanical stretch is also mediated by PI3-K and is followed by an increase in integrin binding to the extracellular matrix proteins ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Therefore , elevated PI3-K activity by activated R-Ras may trigger a sequence of events leading to clustering and activation of integrins , although overexpression of p110alpha-CAAX by itself is not sufficient for inducing beta 1  integrin activation ( XREF_FIG ;  XREF_BIBR ) .
We used the monoclonal antibody HUTS-4 , which detects hybrid domain swing-out in beta 1  integrins , a process most commonly associated with ligand binding affinity ( XREF_BIBR ) , to measure activity of beta 1  integrins and revealed that Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 mediated R-Ras GAP activity suppresses affinity of beta 1  integrins through inactivation of PI3-K activity .
Consistent with our results , a previous report demonstrated that an R-Ras-mediated increase in affinity of the beta 1  integrins is dependent on PI3-K activity by performing the ligand binding assay in mast cells ( XREF_BIBR ) .
On the other hand ,  XREF_BIBR  have shown that PI3-K activity is not required for R-Ras-mediated integrin activation in CHO cells by using a ligand-mimetic antibody , PAC-1 .
Therefore , we speculate that this discrepancy may be due to the differences in ways to measure integrin activity or that R-Ras may regulate integrin activity via both PI3-K-dependent and -independent pathways , depending on the cell type .
In conclusion , our results demonstrate that R-Ras activity is required for ECM mediated integrin activation and cell migration and that the Sema4D and Plexin-B 1 and Rnd1 complex regulates integrin activation and cell migration through the R-Ras GAP activity .
However , a variety of molecules such as ErbB-2 and Met have been known to be involved in plexin signaling , inducing diverse physiological functions ( XREF_BIBR ,  XREF_BIBR ) .
It was recently shown that Plexin-B1 enhances chemotaxis of endothelial cells through the activation of multiple intracellular tyrosine kinase cascades independent of the R-Ras GAP activity ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Regulation of R-Ras activity , tyrosine kinases , and other signaling mechanisms may participate in diverse actions of plexins .
Further work will be required to delineate the precise mechanism of R-Ras-mediated integrin activation and its regulation by plexins for cell migration during physiological and pathological processes , including neural cell migration , angiogenesis , and tumor metastasis .
