Phosphorylation by Akt within the ST loop of AMPK-alpha1 down-regulates its activation in tumour cells .
The insulin and IGF -1 ( insulin like growth factor 1 )-activated protein kinase Akt ( also known as protein kinase B ) phosphorylates Ser 487  in the ' ST loop ' ( serine/threonine rich loop ) within the C-terminal domain of AMPK-alpha1 ( AMP activated protein kinase-alpha1 ) , leading to inhibition of phosphorylation by upstream kinases at the activating site , Thr 172 .
Surprisingly , the equivalent site on AMPK-alpha2 , Ser 491 , is not an Akt target and is modified instead by autophosphorylation .
Stimulation of HEK ( human embryonic kidney ) -293 cells with IGF-1 caused reduced subsequent Thr 172  phosphorylation and activation of AMPK-alpha1in response to the activator A769662 and the Ca 2+  ionophore A23187 , effects we show to be dependent on Akt activation and Ser 487  phosphorylation .
Consistent with this , in three PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 )-null tumour cell lines ( in which the lipid phosphatase PTEN that normally restrains the Akt pathway is absent and Akt is thus hyperactivated ) , AMPK was resistant to activation by A769662 .
However , full AMPK activation could be restored by pharmacological inhibition of Akt , or by re-expression of active PTEN .
We also show that inhibition of Thr 172  phosphorylation is due to interaction of the phosphorylated ST loop with basic side chains within the alphaC-helix of the kinase domain .
Our findings reveal that a previously unrecognized effect of hyperactivation of Akt in tumour cells is to restrain activation of the LKB1 ( liver kinase B1 )-AMPK pathway , which would otherwise inhibit cell growth and proliferation .
INTRODUCTION .
AMPK ( AMP activated protein kinase ) is a ubiquitously expressed sensor of cellular energy status [ XREF_BIBR ] , which exists in essentially all eukaryotic cells as heterotrimeric complexes comprising a catalytic alpha subunit and regulatory beta and gamma subunits .
The alpha subunits are phosphorylated by upstream kinases at conserved threonine residues within the activation loop ( Thr 172  in rat alpha1 and alpha2 ) , causing > 100-fold activation [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Kinases that phosphorylate Thr 172  include the tumour suppressor LKB1 ( liver kinase B1 ) [ XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR ] , and the Ca 2+ -dependent kinase CaMKKbeta ( calmodulin dependent kinase kinase beta ) [ XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR ] .
The gamma subunits contain up to three sites where ADP or AMP bind in competition with ATP [ XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR ] .
Binding of AMP or ADP causes conformational changes that enhance net phosphorylation at Thr 172  by inhibiting dephosphorylation , whereas binding of AMP , but not ADP , promotes phosphorylation by LKB1 and causes allosteric activation [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR ] .
The drug A769662 and the natural product salicylate mimic the ability of AMP to inhibit Thr 172  dephosphorylation and cause allosteric activation , but bind at a different site involving the beta subunit [ XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR ] .
AMPK is thus activated by metabolic stresses that deplete ATP , and increase ADP and AMP .
Such stresses include compounds inhibiting mitochondrial ATP synthesis , such as the anti-diabetic drugs metformin and phenformin , and the natural products galegine , resveratrol and berberine [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Once activated , AMPK switches on catabolic pathways that generate ATP while switching off anabolic pathways and other ATP requiring processes such as progress through the cell cycle [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Thus AMPK has a cytostatic effect on proliferating cells , suggesting that it might exert some of the tumour suppressor effects of its upstream kinase , LKB1 .
This was supported by recent studies of a mouse B-cell lymphoma model , in which AMPK appeared to act as a negative regulator both of the rapid glycolysis ( Warburg effect ) and the high growth rate of the tumours [ XREF_BIBR ] .
If the LKB1-AMPK pathway acts as a tumour suppressor , one might expect many tumour cells to have been selected for mechanisms that down-regulate it .
Indeed , somatic loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding LKB1 ( STK11 ) occur in approximately 30 % of non-small-cell lung cancers [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] and 20 % of cervical cancers [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In the HeLa cell , derived from a cervical cancer that had undergone a large deletion in STK11 [ XREF_BIBR ] , increases in AMP and ADP do not enhance Thr 172  phosphorylation [ XREF_BIBR ] because the basal activity of CaMKKbeta is too low to support this unless intracellular Ca 2+  is also elevated [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Somatic mutations in genes encoding AMPK appear to be less frequent in tumours than those in STK11 , perhaps due to redundancy between multiple AMPK isoforms .
However , there may be epigenetic or non genetic mechanisms by which AMPK is down-regulated in tumour cells .
For example , AMPK-alpha2 expression appears to be frequently down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The PI3K ( phosphoinositide 3-kinase )-Akt ( protein kinase B ) signalling pathway is frequently activated in tumour cells , often via loss of the tumour suppressor PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 ) , but also via activating mutations in subunits of PI3K or upstream receptors [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Interestingly , Akt phosphorylates the alpha1 subunit of rat AMPK at Ser 485  ( equivalent to Ser 487  in human alpha1 ) , and this was reported to reduce subsequent Thr 172  phosphorylation and activation by LKB1 [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Additionally , PKA ( protein kinase A ; also known as cAMP dependent protein kinase ) was reported to phosphorylate Ser 485  with similar effects [ XREF_BIBR ] .
High glucose and IGF-1 ( insulin like growth factor 1 ) also caused phosphorylation of AMPK-alpha1 at Ser 487  in porcine vascular smooth muscle cells , and this was associated with reduced Thr 172  phosphorylation in response to metformin [ XREF_BIBR ] .
This mechanism has also been invoked to account for down-regulation of AMPK in human hepatoma cells infected with hepatitis C virus [ XREF_BIBR ] .
However , these studies did not provide definitive proof that the Ser 485 / Ser 487  phosphorylation and the reduced Thr 172  phosphorylation observed in the intact cells were causally related .
Ser 487  is located in a loop ( residues 472-525in human alpha1 ) that is present in the sequences of alpha subunits from vertebrates and Caenorhabditis elegans , but is truncated or absent in insects ( Drosophila melanogaster ) and fungi ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae )                                                                                                                                                                                   .
This loop was disordered in the crystal structure of a partial mammalian alphabetagamma complex expressed in bacteria [ XREF_BIBR ] .
We now refer to it as the ' ST loop ' because it is rich in serine and threonine residues , and it has recently been shown to be phosphorylated by GSK3 ( glycogen synthase kinase 3 ) at Thr 481  and Ser 477  ( human numbering ) , which appeared to promote Thr 172  dephosphorylation [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In the present study , we have examined whether phosphorylation of this loop causes down-regulation of AMPK in tumour cells in which the Akt pathway is hyperactivated .
We also provide evidence that the ST loop binds to the kinase domain when phosphorylated at Ser 487  by interactions with the alphaC helix , thus physically blocking access to Thr 172 .

After extensive washing , the immunoprecipitates were assayed for AMPK activity as described [ XREF_BIBR ] using the AMARA peptide .
Lysates from other cells ( which did not express tagged recombinant AMPK ) were immunoprecipitated and assayed for AMPK in the same way , except that anti-alpha1 or anti-alpha2 antibody bound to Protein G-Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) was used in place of anti-FLAG antibody .

Cloning , expression , purification and phosphorylation of the ST loop peptide .
DNA encoding residues 466-525 from human AMPK-alpha1 were amplified by PCR to include an N-terminal XhoI site and a C-terminal His 6 -tag followed by a KpnI site , allowing insertion into pGEXKG ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) .
Cultures were grown at 37degreesC until the D 600  reached ~ 0.6 , when cultures were induced with 1mM IPTG and kept at 20degreesC overnight .
The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation ( 7500g , 15min , 4degreesC ) , lysed under liquid N 2  using a pestle and mortar , and resuspended in 50mM Tris and HCl , pH8 .1 , 500mM NaCl , 20mM imidazole and the EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) .
The protein was purified using a HisTrap FF column ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) .
Fractions containing protein were pooled and incubated for 30min at 30degreesC with 5mM MgCl 2  and 200muM ATP-gamma-phosphorothioate in the presence or absence of His 6 -tagged Akt .
The mixture was then applied to a 1ml GST FF column ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) .

RESULTS .
Akt phosphorylates Ser 487  on AMPK-alpha1 , but not the equivalent site on AMPK-alpha2 .
Akt phosphorylates serine or threonine residues within the sequence motif RXRXXS and TPhi , where Phi is a bulky hydrophobic residue [ XREF_BIBR ] .
XREF_FIG ( A ) shows an alignment of this consensus with sequences around some established Akt targets , the ST loop sequence containing Ser 487  in human alpha1 , and the equivalent site on alpha2 ( Ser 491 ) .
Both of the latter have a serine residue at P-2 , with Akt having a preference for the serine or threonine residue at this position [ XREF_BIBR ] .
However , both also have a proline residue rather than arginine at the P-5 position , and Ser 491  also has an alanine residue rather than a bulky hydrophobic residue at P +1 .
Neither is therefore a perfect fit to the Akt consensus ; Scansite 2.0 [ XREF_BIBR ] identifies Ser 487  as a potential Akt site only at medium stringency , and Ser 491  only at low stringency .
To avoid complications caused by autophosphorylation , we initially used inactive mutants of human AMPK complexes ( alpha1-D159A/beta2/gamma1 and alpha2-D157A/beta2/gamma1 ) , with or without alpha1-S487A or alpha2 S491A mutations , as substrates for phosphorylation by human Akt .
For comparison , we used an inactive ( D200A ) mutant of the known Akt substrate GSK3beta , with or without mutation of the Akt site ( Ser 9 ) .
Interestingly , AMPK-alpha1 was a reasonable substrate for Akt although not as good as GSK3 , whereas AMPK-alpha2 was a very poor substrate .
Using either an anti-pS9 antibody or by  32 P labelling , phosphorylation of GSK3beta was saturated at 0.5 unit/ml Akt , when the phosphorylation stoichiometry by  32 P labelling was 1.03 mol and mol ( XREF_FIGB ) .
The phosphorylation of AMPK-alpha1 within the alpha1beta2gamma1 complex was only saturated at 5units/ml , when the stoichiometry was 0.96 mol and mol ( XREF_FIGC ) .
For both GSK3beta and AMPK-alpha1 , the signals obtained using phospho specific antibodies ( pS9 and pS487 ) or  32 P labelling were abolished by mutation of the respective sites to alanine ( S9A and S487A ) .
By contrast , there was much less phosphorylation of Ser 491  within the alpha2beta2gamma1 complex ( XREF_FIGD ) .
By  32 P labelling , the stoichiometry of alpha2 phosphorylation was only 0.18 mol and mol , even with Akt at 30- and 300-fold higher concentrations than those required to obtain stoichiometric phosphorylation of alpha1 and GSK3beta respectively .
Although we did detect some phosphorylation of Ser 491  using a phospho specific antibody and this was abolished in a S491A mutant ,  32 P labelling was not affected by the S491A mutation , suggesting that the low level of alpha2 phosphorylation by Akt was mainly accounted for by modification at other site ( s ) .
Ser 487  phosphorylation reduces Thr 172  phosphorylation : studies with inactive AMPK .
We next tested the ability of the human LKB1 , STRADalpha , and MO25alpha complex to phosphorylate Thr 172  in an inactive ( alpha1-D157A ) human alpha1beta2gamma1 complex .
Before phosphorylation by Akt , the rate of phosphorylation of Thr 172  by the LKB1 complex was unaffected by an S487A mutation , although an S487D mutation reduced the rate of Thr 172  phosphorylation by approximately 30 % ( XREF_FIGE ) .
When the inactive ( D157A ) mutant complex was first phosphorylated by Akt under conditions that yielded stoichiometric Ser 487  phosphorylation , subsequent phosphorylation of Thr 172  was reduced by approximately 40 % , an effect abolished by an S487A mutation ( XREF_FIGF ) .
Phosphorylation of Ser 491  on AMPK-alpha2 is due to autophosphorylation .
We next tested the effects of Akt on either WT , S487A or S491A mutants of active alpha1beta2gamma1 and alpha2beta2gamma1 complexes .
XREF_FIG ( A ) shows that with the alpha1beta2gamma1 complex there was slight phosphorylation of Ser 487  even in the absence of Akt , although phosphorylation of this site increased markedly with increasing Akt .
By contrast , Ser 491  in an alpha2beta2gamma1 complex appeared to be fully phosphorylated in the absence of Akt , and addition of Akt had no further effect .
These results suggested that Ser 491  was modified by autophosphorylation , whereas Ser 487  is phosphorylated by Akt , with a small degree of autophosphorylation .
Consistent with this , there was substantial phosphorylation of Ser 491  in a human alpha2beta2gamma1 complex , and slight phosphorylation of Ser 487  in a human alpha1beta2gamma1 complex , when they were incubated with MgATP alone ; these effects were completely abolished by D157A mutations that rendered the complexes inactive , although Ser 487  could still be phosphorylated by Akt in the inactive complex ( XREF_FIGB ) .
Unlike the equivalent alpha1beta2gamma1 complexes , where the S487D mutant was phosphorylated at a lower rate ( XREF_FIGE ) , the WT , S491A and S491D mutant alpha2beta2gamma1 complexes were phosphorylated on Thr 172  at equal rates by LKB1 ( XREF_FIGC ) .
We also synthesized peptides corresponding to the sequences around Ser 485  on rat alpha1 ( S485 , TPQRSGSISNYRS ) or Ser 491  on rat and human alpha2 ( S491 , TPQRSCSAAGLHR ) , and compared them as AMPK substrates with the classical SAMS peptide [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Although the SAMS peptide was by far the best substrate , the S491 peptide was also phosphorylated , whereas the S485 peptide was not phosphorylated at all .
The results were identical with rat liver AMPK ( a mixture of alpha1beta1gamma1 and alpha2beta1gamma1 complexes ) or with recombinant human alpha1beta2gamma1 and alpha2beta2gamma1 complexes ( XREF_FIGD ) .
Ser 487  phosphorylation reduces Thr 172  phosphorylation : studies with active AMPK .
We next incubated the active alpha1beta2gamma1 complex with Akt under conditions where we obtained stoichiometric phosphorylation of Ser 487 , and subsequently treated with the LKB1 complex under conditions where we could measure the initial rate of Thr 172  phosphorylation and consequent activation .
As with the inactive complex ( XREF_FIGF ) , prior Akt phosphorylation reduced the rate of subsequent Thr 172  phosphorylation ( XREF_FIGA ) , but using the active complex this could also be seen to be associated with a reduction in activation by LKB1 of approximately 40 % ( XREF_FIGB ) ; both effects were abolished by an S487A mutation within the ST loop .
XREF_FIG ( C ) shows that the inhibitory effect of prior Ser 487  phosphorylation on Thr 172  phosphorylation and AMPK activation was identical using either LKB1 or CaMKKbeta , showing that the effect is independent of the upstream kinase utilized .
Phosphorylation of Ser 487  in intact cells reduces LKB1 dependent AMPK activation .
To test the effects of Ser 487  phosphorylation in intact cells , we generated isogenic HEK-293 cells stably expressing FLAG tagged WT AMPK-alpha1 or AMPK-alpha2 , or a non phosphorylatable ( S487A ) alpha1 mutant .
We have shown previously that when AMPK-beta [ XREF_BIBR ] or AMPK-gamma [ XREF_BIBR ] subunits are expressed using this system , they largely replace the endogenous subunit because they compete for the available alpha/gamma or alpha/beta partners , with free subunits being unstable .
This was also true in the present study because we showed that approximately 70 % of the total AMPK activity could be immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody , with the remaining 30 % ( representing a small proportion with endogenous alpha subunits ) being subsequently precipitated using anti-alpha1 or anti-alpha2 antibodies .
The presence of a small amount of endogenous alpha subunits does not affect interpretation of the kinase assays shown in XREF_FIG , which were conducted in anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitates , but a small proportion of AMPK-alpha subunits detected in the Western blots ( e.g. the faint signal obtained using the anti-pS487 antibody in the cells expressing the S487A mutant ) may be due to these endogenous subunits .
The cells expressing AMPK-alpha1 were serum starved , and some were then treated with IGF-1 to activate Akt .
As expected , IGF-1 resulted in marked increases in phosphorylation of the activating sites on Akt ( Thr 308  and Ser 473 ) , which were blocked by the Akt inhibitor MK2206 [ XREF_BIBR ] , as was the phosphorylation of Ser 9 / Ser 21  on GSK3-alpha and beta ( markers of Akt activation ) and Ser 487  on AMPK-alpha1 ( XREF_FIGA ) .
When cells expressing WT alpha1 were treated with A769662 , the activation of AMPK , and Thr 172  phosphorylation , was markedly blunted if the cells had been exposed previously to IGF-1 , an effect abolished by MK2206 .
The effect of IGF-1 to reduce AMPK activation and phosphorylation of Thr 172  correlated with increased Ser 487  phosphorylation , and was absent in cells expressing the S487A mutant ( XREF_FIGB ) .
Ser 491  on AMPK-alpha2 is not phosphorylated by Akt , but by autophosphorylation .
XREF_FIG ( C ) shows results obtained when serum starved cells expressing WT AMPK-alpha1 or AMPK-alpha2 were treated either with IGF-1 or with berberine , which activates AMPK by inhibiting mitochondrial ATP synthesis [ XREF_BIBR ] .
As expected , treatment of alpha1 expressing cells with IGF-1 caused increased phosphorylation of Ser 487 , but not Thr 172 , whereas treatment with berberine caused increased phosphorylation of Thr 172 , accompanied by AMPK activation , but not Ser 487 .
This contrasted markedly with results in alpha2 expressing cells , where treatment with IGF-1 did not increase phosphorylation of Ser 491 , whereas treatment with berberine caused increased phosphorylation of both Ser 491  and Thr 172 , together with AMPK activation .
The results for phosphorylation of Ser 487  and Ser 491  were very similar whether we used in-house phospho specific antibodies that are isoform specific , or a commercial antibody that recognizes the equivalent sites on both alpha1 and alpha2 .
These results are consistent with the results in XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG , showing that Ser 491  on alpha2 is modified by autophosphorylation , and not by Akt as for Ser 487  on alpha1 .
As expected , increased phosphorylation of the downstreamAMPK target ACC correlated with Thr 172  phosphorylation and AMPKactivation in both cell lines .
Ser 487  is phosphorylated by Akt and not by a kinase downstream of mTORC1 [ mammalian ( or mechanistic ) target of rapamycin complex 1 ] .
To confirm that Ser 487  was phosphorylated directly by Akt in the cells , and not by a downstream kinase such as p70 S6K1 , we tested the effects of rapamycin , an inhibitor of mTORC1 .
Rapamycin did not block the IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser 487  on alpha1 or Ser 473  on Akt although , as expected , it blocked phosphorylation of an established mTORC1 substrate , Thr 389  on the p70 and p85 isoforms of S6K1 ( XREF_FIGD ) .
Phosphorylation of Ser 487  in intact cells reduces CaMKKbeta dependent AMPK activation .
To show that phosphorylation of Ser 487  on AMPK-alpha1 by Akt could also reduce subsequent activation by CaMKKbeta , we used the LKB1-null G361 melanoma cell line .
The cells were serum starved , and some were then treated with IGF-1 to activate Akt .
As expected , IGF-1 resulted in marked increases in phosphorylation of Thr 308  and Ser 473  on Akt , Ser 9 / Ser 21  on GSK3alpha and beta and Ser 487  on AMPK-alpha1 , all of which were blocked or reduced by MK2206 ( XREF_FIG ) .
When the cells were treated with the Ca 2+  ionophore A23187 to activate CaMKKbeta , the activation of AMPK and Thr 172  phosphorylation , was significantly blunted if the cells had been exposed previously to IGF-1 , an effect completely abolished by MK2206 ( XREF_FIG ) .
AMPK activation is reduced in PTEN-null tumour cells in an Akt dependent manner .
To examine whether hyperactivation of Akt in tumour cells due to PTEN loss might also inhibit AMPK activation , we initially examined the PTEN-null glioblastoma cell line DBTRG-05MG .
We first tested a range of AMPK activators to see whether any interfered with Akt activation .
Surprisingly , phenformin and quercetin blocked phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 , although berberine , A769662 and A23187 did not                                                                                                                                                                                    .
As expected , all agents also increased the phosphorylation of ACC1 at Ser 79  and AMPK at Thr 172  in MEFs ( mouse embryonic fibroblasts ) , although the effect of A769662 on Thr 172  phosphorylation was small , indicating that it was mainly acting through an allosteric mechanism                           .
The inhibitory effects of phenformin and quercetin on Akt Ser 473  phosphorylation were observed in WT MEFs , but were ' off-target ' AMPK independent effects , because they were also observed in double-knockout ( alpha1 -/-  alpha2 -/- ) MEFs                                   .
To avoid this complication , in subsequent studies we focused on the effects of A769662 , which activates AMPK by direct binding to the beta subunit [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] and does not inhibit ATP synthesis [ XREF_BIBR ] or Akt Ser 473  phosphorylation                          .
AMPK in DBTRG-05MG cells was activated by A769662 , but activation ( XREF_FIGA ) and Thr 172  phosphorylation ( XREF_FIGB ) were greatly enhanced when the selective Akt inhibitor MK2206 was added before A769662 .
Thus reduced activation of AMPK in these cells was Akt dependent .
As expected , inhibition of Akt by MK2206 was associated with greatly reduced phosphorylation of Ser 487 , and of the Akt site on GSK3beta , Ser 9  ( XREF_FIGB ) .
As reported previously [ XREF_BIBR ] , MK2206 also blocked the phosphorylation of Akt at the activating sites , Thr 308  and Ser 473 .
We also examined the effect of re-expressing PTEN in DBTRG-05MG cells , using a lentiviral vector that gives levels of expression similar to normal cells .
As a control , we expressed a C124S mutant that has no lipid phosphatase activity .
Prior expression of WT PTEN enhanced the activation ( XREF_FIGC ) and Thr 172  phosphorylation ( XREF_FIGD ) of AMPK in response to A769662 .
When compared with the C124S mutant , expression of WT PTEN was associated with decreased phosphorylation of Ser 487  on AMPK-alpha1 and Ser 9  on GSK3beta , and markedly decreased phosphorylation of Thr 308  and Ser 473  on Akt ( XREF_FIGD ) .
We also studied two other PTEN-null human cell lines , i.e. U373-MG ( another glioblastoma line ) and MDA-MB-468 ( a breast cancer line ) .
Similar to the DBTRG-05MG cells , there was a modest activation ( XREF_FIGE and XREF_FIGG ) and Thr 172  phosphorylation ( XREF_FIGF and XREF_FIGH ) of AMPK in response to A769662 , but both were enhanced when Akt was inhibited using MK2206 .
The phosphorylated ST loop interacts with the kinase domain , hindering access to Thr 172 .
We next addressed the mechanism by which Ser 487  phosphorylation inhibits subsequent Thr 172  phosphorylation .
In the structure of a partial mammalian alpha1beta2gamma1 complex , the ST loop from Ile 470  to Asp 523  ( rat numbering ) was disordered [ XREF_BIBR ] ; the complex had been expressed in bacteria , so the ST loop was likely to be unphosphorylated .
In a subsequent structure [ XREF_BIBR ] , the ST loop was deleted as it was thought that it might hinder crystallization .
However , the location of the residues at the ends of the loop ( Glu 469  and Val 524 ) in this structure show that they lie close to the kinase domain , being approximately 20 and 40 A ( 1 A = 0.1 nm ) from Thr 172  respectively ( XREF_FIGA ) .
We hypothesized that the ST loop might interact with the kinase domain when phosphorylated on Ser 487 .
We also noticed three basic residues , Arg 62 , Lys 69  and Arg 72  ( rat alpha1 numbering ) , which are located within the ' alphaC helix ' of the small lobe of the kinase domain .
An extension of our hypothesis was that phosphate groups on the ST loop interact with these basic side chains , triggering a stable interaction between the ST loop and the kinase domain that physically blocks access of Thr 172  to upstream kinases .
To test the first hypothesis , we made a construct expressing the peptide from Arg 466  to Asp 525  on human alpha1 as a GST fusion .
The protein was expressed in and purified from bacteria , the GST domain removed , and the remaining peptide ( Arg 466 -Asp 525 ) either thiophosphorylated using ATPgammaS ( adenosine 5 '-[ gamma-thio ] triphosphate ) and Akt ( thiophosphate being resistant to protein phosphatases ) , or left unphosphorylated .
Consistent with our hypothesis , the phosphopeptide caused a concentration dependent inhibition of activation and Thr 172  phosphorylation of the bacterially expressed alpha1beta2gamma1 complex by LKB1 , although we were unable to generate the peptide at high enough concentrations to fully saturate inhibition .
By contrast , the unphosphorylated peptide had no effect ( XREF_FIGB ) .
To confirm that the inhibition of activation loop phosphorylation was specific to AMPK , we showed that neither the phospho- nor the dephospho-peptide inhibited activation and phosphorylation of the AMPK related kinase BRSK2 by LKB1 ( XREF_FIGC ) .
To test the extended hypothesis , we made a triple mutation ( R64A/K71A/R74A , human alpha1 numbering , ' AAA mutant ' ) , in the context of the recombinant human alpha1beta2gamma1 complex used in XREF_FIG , of the three basic residues in the kinase domain that we propose to interact with phosphate groups on the ST loop .
Consistent with our hypothesis , prior phosphorylation of the WT complex by Akt reduced subsequent activation and Thr 172  phosphorylation by LKB1 , but this effect was completely abolished by either an S487A mutant or an AAA mutant , even though the latter was still phosphorylated on Ser 487  by Akt ( XREF_FIGD ) .
DISCUSSION .
It has been reported previously that prior phosphorylation of Ser 485  on rat AMPK-alpha1 by Akt , within a rat alpha1beta1gamma1 complex , caused a 40 % reduction in the rate of subsequent phosphorylation of Thr 172  and activation by LKB1in cell-free assays , an effect that was abolished by a non phosphorylatable S485A substitution [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In the present study , we have followed up this observation and made several new findings .
First , we demonstrated identical effects with the equivalent site ( Ser 487 ) on the human alpha1beta2gamma1 complex ( XREF_FIGF and XREF_FIG ) , showing that the effect is conserved in humans and is also independent of the beta subunit isoform .
Secondly , we show that the effect is not specific to the upstream kinase LKB1 , but is also observed with CaMKKbeta ( XREF_FIGC ) .
Thirdly , we report that Ser 491  ( the site equivalent to Ser 487  in AMPK-alpha2 ) is an extremely poor substrate for Akt , and that the very low level of alpha2 phosphorylation obtained using Akt is not affected by an S491A mutation ( XREF_FIGD ) .
It had been shown previously using a bacterially expressed alpha2beta1gamma1 complex that Akt phosphorylated AMPK-alpha2 , albeit more slowly than alpha1 [ XREF_BIBR ] and , although the phosphorylation site ( s ) had not been identified , it has generally been assumed that this phosphorylation occurred at Ser 491 .
That Ser 491  is modified instead by autophosphorylation is shown by the following findings : ( i ) substantial phosphorylation of Ser 491  occurred with the recombinant human alpha2beta2gamma1 complex in the absence of exogenous kinases ( XREF_FIGA and XREF_FIGB ) ; ( ii ) Ser 491  phosphorylation did not occur with an inactive ( D157A mutant ) complex ( XREF_FIGB ) ; ( iii ) various forms of AMPK , including the human alpha2beta2gamma1 complex , phosphorylated a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence around Ser 491 , but not Ser 485  on rat alpha1 ( XREF_FIGD ) ; and ( iv ) Ser 491  on AMPK-alpha2 became phosphorylated in response to the AMPK activator berberine in HEK-293 cells , whereas Ser 487  on AMPK-alpha1 did not ( XREF_FIGC ) .
Although further work is required to test whether autophosphorylation of Ser 491  down-regulates Thr 172  phosphorylation , this is not supported by the results in XREF_FIG ( C ) , where the activation of the human alpha2beta2gamma1 complex by LKB1 was not affected by a potentially phosphomimetic S491D mutation .
Thus the ability of Akt activating treatments such as insulin and IGF-1 to restrain activation of AMPK by ST loop phosphorylation is limited to complexes containing the alpha1 isoform .
Although Ser 487  in the human alpha1beta2gamma1 complex also appeared to autophosphorylate to a limited extent in cell-free assays ( XREF_FIGA ) , increased Ser 487  phosphorylation did not occur when intact cells were incubated with the AMPK activator berberine ( XREF_FIGC ) , suggesting that autophosphorylation of Ser 487  is not significant in intact cells .
Interestingly , the small degree of Ser 487  autophosphorylation in cell-free assays did not increase when the alpha1beta2gamma1 complex was activated by phosphorylation at Thr 172  by LKB1 ( XREF_FIGB , top left ) , suggesting that Thr 172  phosphorylation ( unlike its effects on phosphorylation of exogenous substrates ) does not enhance Ser 487  autophosphorylation .
Our results show that Ser 487  in human alpha1 , unlike Ser 491  in alpha2 , is a good substrate for Akt .
Although only phosphorylated in cell-free assays at approximately 10 % of the rate of Ser 9  on GSK3-beta ( a canonical Akt site ) , in the intact cells the net phosphorylation status would also be affected by the activity of protein phosphatases acting on Ser 487 .
The results using MK2206in XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG clearly confirm that Ser 487  is phosphorylated in four distinct cell lines in an Akt dependent manner .
In good agreement with previous results obtained with the rat alpha1beta1gamma1 complex [ XREF_BIBR ] , prior phosphorylation of Ser 487  on the human alpha1beta2gamma1 complex caused a 40 % reduction in subsequent phosphorylation of Thr 172  both in active ( XREF_FIGA ) and inactive ( XREF_FIGF ) AMPK complexes , and a reduction in the activation of the active complex ( XREF_FIGB ) .
Although a 40 % effect might appear to be quite modest , the effect appears to be larger in intact cells ( XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG ) , where the activities of phosphatases acting on Ser 487  would affect the outcome .
Another explanation for the different size of the effect in cell-free assays and intact cells is that other sites in the ST loop may be phosphorylated in the intact cells , a possibility discussed further below .
By using HEK-293 cells expressing recombinant AMPK-alpha1 , we showed not only that the effect of prior IGF-1 treatment to inhibit subsequent AMPK activation by A769662 was dependent on Akt , but also that it was dependent on phosphorylation of Ser 487 , since the effect was completely abolished in cells expressing a non phosphorylatable S487A mutant ( XREF_FIG ) .
It has been reported recently that Ser 491  on AMPK-alpha2 can be phosphorylated by S6K1 [ XREF_BIBR ] , so we considered the possibility that Ser 487  might have been phosphorylated by a kinase downstream of Akt and mTORC1 , such as S6K1 , rather than directly by Akt .
However , the phosphorylation of Ser 487  was not affected by rapamycin ( XREF_FIGD ) , so was not catalysed by S6K1 or any other kinase downstream of mTORC1 .
Using the LKB1-null G361 cell line treated with the Ca 2+  ionophore A23187 , we also showed that phosphorylation of Thr 172 , and activation of AMPK , by CaMKKbeta was antagonized by prior phosphorylation of Ser 487 .
This supports results obtained in cell-free assays ( XREF_FIGC ) , and shows that the effect in intact cells is independent of the upstream kinase utilized .
Surprisingly , we found that phosphorylation of Akt at the mTORC2 site , Ser 473 , was blocked by certain AMPK activators including phenformin and quercetin , although not by berberine , A769662 or A23817 .
Although the mechanism for this effect remains unclear , it is clearly an off-target AMPK independent effect , because it was still observed in AMPK-knockout MEFs                          .
To place our studies in the context of tumour cells , we also addressed whether AMPK activation was down-regulated in three PTEN-null tumour cell lines derived from human cancers .
Interestingly , in two glioblastoma cell lines and a breast cancer cell line in which Akt was hyperactivated due to loss of PTEN , AMPK was rather resistant to activation and Thr 172  phosphorylation induced by the activator A769662 .
However , this effect was reversed by the addition of MK2206 , a selective inhibitor of Akt activation that also reduced or abolished the phosphorylation of AMPK-alpha1 on Ser 487 , of GSK3beta on Ser 9  and of Akt itself on Thr 308  and Ser 473 .
These effects could also be reversed in DBTRG-05MG cells by re-expressing WT PTEN , but not a phosphatase-inactive ( C124S ) mutant .
Our results suggest that a previously unrecognized effect of PTEN loss is to reduce the potential restraint on cell growth and proliferation provided by activation of AMPK .
This mechanism would also be expected to operate in tumour cells in which Akt is hyperactivated due to activating mutations in subunits of PI3K , or mutation or overexpression of upstream receptors [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Previous evidence suggests that this mechanism also operates in human hepatoma ( Huh-7 ) cells infected with the hepatitis C virus [ XREF_BIBR ] , where PI3K is activated due to association with a non structural protein encoded by the viral RNA [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In that case , expression of viral proteins was reduced by treating the infected Huh-7 cells with AMPK activators such as AICAR ( 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside ) or metformin [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Finally , our results suggest a molecular mechanism by which prior phosphorylation at Ser 487  inhibits subsequent phosphorylation of Thr 172 , and hence activation , by upstream kinases .
In a partial alpha1beta2gamma1 complex containing rat alpha1 , which was expressed in bacteria and where Ser 485  was therefore most likely unphosphorylated , the ST loop from Glu 469  to Val 524  was not resolved , indicating that it was mobile within the crystal [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Our hypothesis is that the ST loop interacts with residues within the kinase domain when Ser 487  is phosphorylated , hindering the ability of upstream kinases to gain access to Thr 172 .
This hypothesis is supported by the results in XREF_FIG , showing that a peptide corresponding to the sequence from Arg 466  to Asp 525  on human alpha1 inhibits activation and Thr 172  phosphorylation of an alpha1beta2gamma1 complex by LKB1 , but only when phosphorylated on the residue corresponding to Ser 487 .
This is an extremely specific effect , because the phosphopeptide had no effect on the activation or phosphorylation by LKB1 of BRSK2 , which ( with BRSK1 ) has the kinase domain most closely related to AMPK-alpha1 and AMPK-alpha2 within the human kinome .
The 54 residues of the ST loop in human AMPK-alpha1 contains 15 serine residues ( including Ser 487 ) and five threonine residues , most of which are conserved in alpha1 subunits from other vertebrates and in C. elegans                          .
It has been shown recently that GSK3beta phosphorylates the ST loop at multiple sites , with site directed mutagenesis suggesting that the initial phosphorylation was at Thr 481 , followed by Ser 477  and perhaps Thr 473  ( human alpha1 residue numbering ; in rats the equivalent residues are Thr 479 , Ser 475  and Thr 471 ) .
Thr 481  phosphorylation was proposed to inhibit net Thr 172  phosphorylation by enhancing its sensitivity to dephosphorylation [ XREF_BIBR ] .
With most substrates , phosphorylation by GSK3 requires ' priming ' by another kinase , because the kinase usually phosphorylates a serine or threonine residue located four residues N-terminal to an existing phosphoamino acid [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In the case of AMPK it was proposed that phosphorylation of Ser 487  on rat AMPK-alpha1 might promote phosphorylation of Thr 481 , although not by conventional priming because the residue spacing is not appropriate , and because phosphorylation was not affected by a GSK3beta mutation that reduces phosphorylation of primed substrates [ XREF_BIBR ] .
If the hypothesis by Suzuki et al. [ XREF_BIBR ] is correct , phosphorylation of Ser 487  may lead to additional phosphorylation events within the ST loop .
This might explain why we observed a larger effect on AMPK activation and Thr 172  phosphorylation by modulation of Akt in intact cells than in cell-free assays ( compare XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG with XREF_FIG-XREF_FIG ) .
Although GSK3beta was phosphorylated at Ser 9  in response to Akt treatment and this normally inhibits GSK3 activity [ XREF_BIBR ] , this inhibition does not occur with ' unprimed ' substrates [ XREF_BIBR ] as proposed for Thr 481  [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Thus it is possible that phosphorylation of Ser 487  in our intact cell experiments promoted additional phosphorylation events , such as phosphorylation of Thr 481  and Ser 477  by GSK3 .
As an extension of this hypothesis , we propose that the side chains of three basic residues located in the alphaC helix of the small lobe of the kinase domain ( Arg 64 , Lys 71  and Arg 74  in human alpha1 ) interact with multiple phosphate groups attached to the ST loop , thus anchoring the ST loop to the kinase domain and blocking access of Thr 172  to upstream kinases .
Interestingly , although at least one of these ( Arg 64  or Lys 71 ) is conserved in all 12 AMPK related kinases , none are conserved in the archetypal serine/threonine kinase domain of PKA .
Consistent with our hypothesis , a human alpha1beta2gamma1 complex containing an ' AAA ' mutation ( R64A/K71A/K74A ) was completely resistant to the ability of previous Akt phosphorylation to reduce the rate of Thr 172  phosphorylation by LKB1 ( XREF_FIGD ) .
Also consistent with this model was our finding that prior Akt phosphorylation reduced activation by both upstream kinases ( LKB1 and CaMKKbeta ) to very similar extents ( XREF_FIGC ) .
Final confirmation of this model will require structural analysis of AMPK complexes where the ST loop is present in a phosphorylated form , rather than being unphosphorylated or deleted as in existing structures [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Since AMPK activators such as AICAR or metformin can overcome the inhibitory effects of Ser 487  phosphorylation on replication of the hepatitis C virus [ XREF_BIBR ] , our present results raise the exciting prospect that AMPK activators such as metformin , which are already used to treat Type2 diabetes , might also be efficacious in treatment of tumours in which the Akt pathway is hyperactivated .
It is already known from retrospective studies that treatment of diabetics with metformin is associated with a lower incidence of cancer compared with other medications [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , although it is not yet certain that this effect is mediated by AMPK .
Our results suggest that clinical trials to test the efficacy of metformin for cancer treatment might be targeted at specific classes of tumour , such as those in which Akt is hyper-activated .
